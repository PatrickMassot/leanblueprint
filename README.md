# Lean blueprints

This is a [plasTeX](https://github.com/plastex/plastex/) plugin allowing
to write blueprints for Lean 4 projects.

Needs graphviz and its deve libraries.
`sudo apt install graphviz libgraphviz-dev`

## Migration from Lean 3

The plugin has dropped support for Lean 3. If you have a Lean 3 blueprint project and want to use the latest version of the plugin, you need to do the following:

1. Port your Lean 3 code to Lean 4, likely with the help of [mathport](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathport)
2. Set up [doc-gen4](https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4) for your project, publish it somewhere, e.g. https://your-docgen4-url-base/
3. The new plugin jumps to the documentation generated by `doc-gen4` for `\lean{YourLean4Theorem}` if you have specified `\dochome{https://your-docgen4-url-base/}` in your `web.tex` file. This is equivalent to the old plugin, which jumped to the source code of the theorem in your GitHub repository for `\lean{your_lean3_theorem}`. You need to carefully port all `\lean{your_lean3_theorem}` to `\lean{YourLean4Theorem}`, this could be just a search and replace with the CamelCase version of your theorem name, or it could have been renamed in your Lean 4 porting process.

Use earlier versions (or Github commits) of the plugin if you still need to use Lean 3, which is EOL.
